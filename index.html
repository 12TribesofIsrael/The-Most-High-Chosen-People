        Shalam, Greetings to my beloved people Israel (12 Tribes). To the so called Blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Northern American Indians, Haitians, Jamaicans and the rest of the 12 Tribes, please understand that you are very precious in the eyesight of the creator. He created the world for you and gave you dominion over everything. You are a Holy and special people unto him.

      <h2>Deuteronomy Chapter 4:7-8</h2>
      <p>
        For what nation is there so great, who hath the Most High so nigh unto them, as the Most High our power is in all things that we call upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

      <h3>Precepts to Deuteronomy 4:7</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>2 Samuel 7:23</strong> – And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom the Most High went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?

(Moses asked the children of Israel two questions: "For what nation is there so great? And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law?" We are so holy as a people that as a Nation we are the only people that have statutes, laws, and judgments—look at the precepts.)

      <h2>Deuteronomy 7:6-8</h2>
      <p>
        For thou art an holy people unto the Most High thy power: the Most High thy power hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Most High did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: But because the Most High loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Most High brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

(We are a special people—above all the Gentiles—since the Most High loved us, the 12 Tribes of Israel, and delivered our forefathers from Egypt.)

      <p>
        <strong>Titus 2:14</strong> – "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." (We read in Leviticus 20:24-26 that the children of Israel are so holy that we are separated from the other people (Gentiles) in the world. We are to be holy, for the Most High is holy and has set us apart.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1 Chronicles 17:21-22</strong> – "And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom the Most High went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

        <strong>Romans 9:4</strong> – "Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of the Most High, and the promises."

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Baruch 2:29-35</strong> – "If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, where I will scatter them. For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is a stiffnecked people: but in the land of their captivities they shall remember themselves. And shall know that I am the Most High their power: for I will give them a heart, and ears to hear: And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name, And return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Most High. And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them." (The Most High loves us so much he will give us a heart and ears to hear in the land of our captivity—which is America and across the world.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Joel 3:1-2</strong> – "For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land." (The Father will gather his people to plead for Israel.)

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The whole conclusion is to humble yourself and do the will of the Father when you come into the knowledge of who you are as one of the 12 Tribes of Israel. We are to be a light to the Gentiles so that they may also obtain salvation and the keeping of the law. We are His servants as a Nation and are to do His will and walk righteously as He is righteous. We are so holy and precious that the world was made for the sake of the children of Israel—so let’s walk, talk, and keep His ways so that we may store up good works in Heaven and show our faith with works.
      </p>

        <strong>2 Esdras 7:10-11</strong> – "And I said, It is so, the Most High. Then said he unto me, Even so also is Israel's portion. Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2 Esdras 6:55-56</strong> – "All this have I spoken before thee, O the Most High, because thou madest the world for our sakes; as for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel."
